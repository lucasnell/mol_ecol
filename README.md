## File and folder notes

All fasta files and other large, genome-related data files were kept in a folder
synced to my Box account instead of in this repository.
The file `genome_data` is a [symbolic link](https://kb.iu.edu/d/abbe) to the 
Box folder that is also not present here.

All files starting with `dv_` are files explaining how all steps were developed.
For a given step, the `.md` or `.pdf` file is the one you should examine to understand
the code's overall rationale, and the `.R` file includes all the raw R code, which is 
easier for testing.
