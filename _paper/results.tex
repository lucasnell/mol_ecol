\section{Results}

There were a total of 212,350,000 reads simulated by the ART simulator.
These reads, when aligned to the aphid genome, covered 9,795,971 unique positions.
The distribution of read depths had a small peak at very low depths, with a very large
peak at slightly less than 1,000$\times$, and another, smaller peak at $\sim$1,750$\times$
(Figure \ref{fig:depth}).

There were 151,572 locations containing SNPs. Using these locations to estimate 
abundances resulted in estimates very near actual values (Figure \ref{fig:proportions}).
